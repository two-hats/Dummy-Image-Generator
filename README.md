**You can export images more quickly!!**


This is a script for Adobe illustrator. It allows us to export images more quickly as usual.
There are a few ways to export image in illustrator by default. However, these ways take long time to do it, so I decided to develop this script.

## Installation
Please put this script file and the "img" folder into the script folder of illustrator.

For example in CC 2014.
```
Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe lllustratorCC2014\Presets\[language]\Scripts\
```
```
Mac OS: /Applications/Adobe lllustrator CC 2014/Presets/[language]/Scripts/
```

It works in CS6, CC and CC 2014. I'm sure that it can also work in CS5.

## Usage
You execute this script, then a modeless dialog will appear.

1. Select an extension (PNG/GIF/SVG) you want to export to in advance.
2. Select artworks you require.
3. Push the export button.

That's it. An "images" folder which contains image files will be created on your desktop.

### Options
It has a few options which are useful for making applications and websites.
